# Woomora-style Academic Website (Static HTML)

A minimalist academic website replicating the structure of `woomora.github.io/research.html`, with sections for Publications, Working Papers, Work in Progress, and Resting Papers.

## How to use
1. **Create a new GitHub repo** named `username.github.io` (replace with your GitHub username).
2. Upload the contents of this folder (or unzip the release and drag-drop into your repo).
3. In **Settings â†’ Pages**, set the branch to `main` and the folder to `/ (root)`.
4. Visit `https://username.github.io/research.html` (after a couple of minutes).

## Customisation
- Edit `site.json` for your name, bio, and social links (optional, used only to display text in header).
- Edit `research.html` entries directly (copy/paste `<article class="entry">` blocks).
- Replace images in `assets/img/` and update `alt`/credits accordingly.
